# Ncurses Pong Clone #

Pong clone created using the Ncurses library. Doesn't have an AI opponent yet.
It is also placed vertically instead of horizontally. It is basically like
playing handball on a screen. Will probably add an AI opponent at some point.
Started as an experiment with Ncurses windows, turned into what it is.
Compiled with 'gcc pong.c -lncurses' Do what you wish with it, as it was more
a concept project for personal progress than anything else.
